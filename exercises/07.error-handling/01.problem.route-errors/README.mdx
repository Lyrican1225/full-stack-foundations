# Handle Route Errors

👨‍💼 If you open <InlineFile file="app/routes/users+/$username.tsx" /> and
comment in one of the errors 🐨 added for you,
then try loading <LinkToApp to="/settings/profile" />, you'll notice the error
looks pretty bad. We definitely want to customize that!

Could you please add an `ErrorBoundary` component to both <InlineFile file="app/routes/settings+/profile.tsx" />
and <InlineFile file="app/routes/users_+/$username.tsx" /> so we can handle errors that
happen in our app?

Please make sure to log the error in the console with `console.error` so we can
see what's going on in our debugging.

Note: 🐨 Kody added a couple commented out errors for you to test things out in
different places throughout <InlineFile file="app/routes/settings+/profile.tsx" />.
