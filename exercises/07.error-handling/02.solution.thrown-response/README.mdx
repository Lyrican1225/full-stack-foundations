# Handle Response Errors

👨‍💼 Thanks a lot! This is looking much better than before and our users are
already much happier with this.

🧝‍♂️ I've been working on a handy abstraction for this, which you'll be able to
use next!

💯 If you've got extra time, you can try and build a useful abstraction
yourself before moving on to the next step.
