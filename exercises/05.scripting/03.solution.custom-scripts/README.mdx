# Custom Scripts

<callout-info>
	Please note that the learning objective for this part of the exercise is the
	use of custom inline scripts. The specific script used is to expose
	environment variables following a pattern I still need to write an article
	about. If you struggle to follow the pattern, don't worry about that. Focus on
	what it takes to get a custom inline script running.

üë®‚Äçüíº In our app, we've got some runtime environment variables we want to expose to
the client-side app. You may be used to using `process.env` to access
environment variables, but the browser doesn't have access to our server's
`process.env` (thank goodness). Instead, we need to explicitly provide those
variable's values to our app using <InlineFile file="app/root.tsx" />'s loader.

üßù‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I added a <InlineFile file="app/utils/env.server.ts" /> file which is
responsible for ensuring we have the right environment variables in our server
and makes it easy to get the environment variables that are public and should be
accessible to our UI code.

Remember that UI code runs both on the server and the client. So what we want is
something that allows us to have a common global variable that has all the
environment variables that are public and should be accessible to our UI code.
For example:

```tsx filename=app/routes/connect-discord.tsx lines=7
function ConnectDiscord() {
	return <a href={getDiscordAuthorizeURL()}>Connect to Discord</a>
}

function getDiscordAuthorizeURL(domainUrl: string) {
	const url = new URL('https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize')
	url.searchParams.set('client_id', ENV.DISCORD_CLIENT_ID)
	url.searchParams.set('redirect_uri', `https://example.com/discord/callback`)
	url.searchParams.set('response_type', 'code')
	url.searchParams.set('scope', 'identify guilds.join email guilds')
	return url.toString()
}
```

üßù‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è To do this, I've also created a
custom <InlineFile file="app/entry.server.tsx" /> file which overrides the
default entry file for the server in Remix. That way, we can take care of the
server-side of setting this global variable which I have done on line 6 with:

```tsx lines=6 start=4
import { getEnv } from './utils/env.server.ts'

global.ENV = getEnv()
```

The `env.server.ts` file we have sets up TypeScript to auto-complete the `ENV`
global variable.

üë®‚Äçüíº In this part of the exercise, we need to set the global `ENV` variable on the
client. So when our code hydrates we have access to runtime environment
variables using the same global variable in either environment (server or
client).

Right now, all we need in our app is a `MODE` environment variable which is
`development` or `production`.

Effectively, what we need is a script that does this:

```js
window.ENV = { MODE: 'development' }
```

We can do this in <InlineFile file="app/root.tsx" /> and then we'll use that
`ENV.MODE` variable in <InlineFile file="app/entry.client.tsx" /> to dynamically
load some devtools (found in <InlineFile file="app/utils/devtools.tsx" />) when
we're in development mode (`ENV.MODE === 'development'`).
