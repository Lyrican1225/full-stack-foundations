# Forms

👨‍💼 We need to add support for editing notes.

🧝‍♂️ I've made a few changes since you last were in the codebase. I added a
(non-functional) delete button and a (functional) edit link to the existing note
page. The edit link takes users to a new note edit route which I made as well.
All it has in there is a JSON string of the note data.

👨‍💼 Yep, you'll be required to make a form for the notes edit page. In this first
step we're only expecting you to make the form itself, don't worry about making
it work yet (go ahead and try to submit the form... What status code do you
think you'll get back if you do?).
