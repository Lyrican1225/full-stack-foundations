# Forms

👨‍💼 We need to add support for editing notes. You'll be required to make a form
for the notes edit page. In this first step we're only expecting you to make the
form itself, don't worry about making it work yet (go ahead and try to submit
the form... What status code do you think you'll get back if you do?).
