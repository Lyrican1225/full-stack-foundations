# Compiling CSS

👨‍💼 Even though most of our users are using modern browsers, there are some CSS
features that not all of our users' browsers support. To make sure that our
styles work for everyone, we need to compile our CSS using
[a tool called PostCSS](https://postcss.org/).

Support for this tool is built-in to Remix. As soon as Remix finds configuration
for PostCSS, it will automatically compile the CSS files you import for you as
part of the build process.

🧝‍♂️ I've already added configuration for PostCSS to the project in
the <InlineFile file="postcss.config.js" /> file. You'll notice that we also
have a <InlineFile file="tailwind.config.ts" /> file. This is where we configure
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com), a CSS framework that we'll be using to
style our app. Our PostCSS configuration includes the Tailwind plugin so, we can
use the Tailwind directives in our css files to get the Tailwind stylesheet on
the page. 📜 You can read more about configuring Tailwind with PostCSS in
[the Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/using-with-preprocessors).

👨‍💼 Now all that's left is for you to create
a <InlineFile file="app/styles/tailwind.css" /> file and put in the Tailwind
directives:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Then, using the knowledge you've gained from the previous steps, import this
file and include a link tag for it in the <InlineFile file="app/root.tsx" />
file.

Finally, to test that this worked, you can style the "Hello World" to have a
Tailwind class name like `p-8 text-xl`. If you see the text get bigger and more
spaced, you're all set!
