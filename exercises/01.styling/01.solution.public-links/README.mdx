# Links to Public Files

👨‍💼 We're super excited about this awesome new app! First off, we've got an
awesome favicon for our site in the `public` directory. Browsers will request
the `/favicon.ico` by default, but we've got a
✨ responsive ✨ <InlineFile file="public/favicon.svg" /> that will look good in
light and dark mode (you find a media query embedded in the SVG itself). Let's
get that on the page.

To do this, we'll need to add a `<link>` to <InlineFile file="app/root.tsx" />.

> 🦉 Remember, check the `Files` section at the bottom of these instructions for
> links that will open your editor to the right file you need to alter. My other
> emoji friends will be waiting there for you to guide you through this task.

🦉 Tip: Check the network tab in the app on the home page. You'll know you got
it right when you see the `favicon.svg` file loaded.
