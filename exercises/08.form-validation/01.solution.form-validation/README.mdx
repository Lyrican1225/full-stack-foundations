# Form Validation

👨‍💼 Super! Isn't it cool that the web platform has built-in validation for us?

even hook into this validation via CSS to style things according to their
["validity state"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState)
and JavaScript to completely customize the behavior as well. You can even create
custom validators with
[`setCustomValidity`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLObjectElement/setCustomValidity).
