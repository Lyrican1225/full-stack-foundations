# Field Labels

👨‍💼 We need to update the accessibility of our note edit form. The current
implementation is not accessible because the `<label>` and the `<input />` are
not associated with each other. So it should be something like this:

```tsx
<div>
	<label htmlFor="color">Favorite Color</label>
	<input id="color" type="text" />
</div>
```

Please find Kody in <InlineFile file="app/routes/users+/$username_+/notes.$noteId_.edit.tsx" />
and make sure the label and input have an association via the `id` and `htmlFor`
props.

You can test out whether your changes fixed the problem by clicking on the label
text inside the input. If the input is focused, then you've done it! If not,
then there's still more work to do.
