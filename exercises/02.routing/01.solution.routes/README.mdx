# Routes

There's a lot more to learn about routing in Remix. Your best friend is the
`npx remix routes` command which will help you figure out how your routes are
structured based on your file structure.

The key concepts are:

1. Layout Nesting
2. URL Nesting

Once you nail those two concepts, then routing in Remix will be much more
straightforward.
