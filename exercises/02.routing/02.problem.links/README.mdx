# Links

👨‍💼 Our users want to get around the application quickly. So, we're going to add
a few links in a couple places.

We want the logo in the header and footer to link to `/`.

On the <LinkToApp to="/users/kody" /> page, we want to link to the user's notes
route.

On the <LinkToApp to="/users/kody/notes" /> route, we should link back to the
`/users/kody` page. We should also link to the `/users/kody/notes/some-note-id`
route.

The `Link` component in Remix is a wrapper around the `Link` component from
react router, so you can learn all about it in
[the react router `Link` docs](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/link).

As a bit of extra credit, do your best to leverage relative routes where you can
rather than hard-coding the full path of the route. This will make it easier to
move files around relative to each other in the future.

Also, look into the
[`NavLink`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/nav-link) component so
you can highlight the link to the `some-note-id` route when that child route is
active. You can use the `bg-accent` class name when the link is active.
